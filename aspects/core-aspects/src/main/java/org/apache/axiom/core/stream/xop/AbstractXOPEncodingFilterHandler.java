     * Build a cid URL from the given content ID as described in RFC2392.
     * <p>
     * Note that this implementation only encodes the percent character (replacing it by "%25"). The
     * reason is given by the following quotes from RFC3986:
     * <blockquote>
     * If a reserved character is
     * found in a URI component and no delimiting role is known for that character, then it must be
     * interpreted as representing the data octet corresponding to that character's encoding in
     * US-ASCII. [...]
     * <p>
     * Under normal circumstances, the only time when octets within a URI are percent-encoded is
     * during the process of producing the URI from its component parts. This is when an
     * implementation determines which of the reserved characters are to be used as subcomponent
     * delimiters and which can be safely used as data. [...]
     * <p>
     * Because the percent ("%") character serves as the indicator for percent-encoded octets, it
     * must be percent-encoded as "%25" for that octet to be used as data within a URI.
     * </blockquote>
     * <p>
     * Since RFC2392 doesn't define any subcomponents for the cid scheme and since RFC2045 specifies
     * that only US-ASCII characters are allowed in content IDs, the percent character (which is
     * specifically allowed by RFC2045) is the only character that needs URL encoding.
     * <p>
     * Another reason to strictly limit the set of characters to be encoded is that some
     * applications fail to decode cid URLs correctly if they contain percent encoded octets.
     * 
     * @param contentID the content ID (without enclosing angle brackets)
     * @return the corresponding URL in the cid scheme
