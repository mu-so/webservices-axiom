    /**
     * Serializes element data directly to StAX writer.
     * <p>
     * The implementation of this method must satisfy the following requirements:
     * <ul>
     * <li>The implementation MUST NOT not write any start document or end document event, i.e. it
     * MUST NOT use {@link XMLStreamWriter#writeStartDocument()},
     * {@link XMLStreamWriter#writeStartDocument(String)},
     * {@link XMLStreamWriter#writeStartDocument(String, String)} or
     * {@link XMLStreamWriter#writeEndElement()}.
     * <li>The implementation MUST output a single element (hereafter called the root element). It
     * MUST NOT output any other content before or after that element.
     * <li>The implementation MUST specify the namespace URI when writing an element, i.e. it MUST
     * NOT use the namespace unaware methods {@link XMLStreamWriter#writeStartElement(String)} or
     * {@link XMLStreamWriter#writeEmptyElement(String)}. On the other hand, it MAY use the
     * namespace unaware {@link XMLStreamWriter#writeAttribute(String, String)} method, provided
     * that the specified name is an <tt>NCName</tt>.
     * <li>The implementation MUST ensure that the produced XML is well formed with respect to
     * namespaces, i.e. it MUST generate the required namespace declarations using
     * {@link XMLStreamWriter#writeNamespace(String, String)} and
     * {@link XMLStreamWriter#writeDefaultNamespace(String)}. It MUST NOT assume that the
     * {@link XMLStreamWriter} performs any kind of namespace repairing (although that may be the
     * case).
     * <li>In addition the implementation MAY use {@link XMLStreamWriter#setPrefix(String, String)}
     * and {@link XMLStreamWriter#setDefaultNamespace(String)} to track the namespace declarations
     * it generates, so that the namespace context maintained by the {@link XMLStreamWriter}
     * accurately reflects the namespace context in the output document. However, it MUST NOT call
     * these methods before the start of the root element or after the end of the root element.
     * <li>Since the element may be serialized as part of a larger document, the implementation MUST
     * take into account the pre-existing namespace context (which can be queried using
     * {@link XMLStreamWriter#getPrefix(String)} and {@link XMLStreamWriter#getNamespaceContext()}).
     * This means that the implementation MUST NOT assume that the empty prefix is bound to the
     * empty namespace URI. Therefore if the implementation outputs elements that have no namespace,
     * it MUST generate namespace declarations of the form <tt>xmlns=""</tt> in the appropriate
     * locations. In addition it MAY use the namespace context information to minimize the number of
     * generated namespace declarations (by reusing already bound prefixes).
     * <li>If the implementation produces base64 binary data (that could be optimized using
     * XOP/MTOM), then it SHOULD use
     * {@link XMLStreamWriterUtils#writeDataHandler(XMLStreamWriter, DataHandler, String, boolean)}
     * or
     * {@link XMLStreamWriterUtils#writeDataHandler(XMLStreamWriter, DataHandlerProvider, String, boolean)}
     * to write the data to the stream. If this is not possible (e.g. because the content is
     * produced by a third party library that is not aware of these APIs), then the implementation
     * MUST use the following approach:
     * <ul>
     * <li>If the {@link XMLStreamWriter} is an {@link MTOMXMLStreamWriter}, then the implementation
     * MAY use {@link MTOMXMLStreamWriter#prepareDataHandler(DataHandler)} and generate the
     * necessary <tt>xop:Include</tt> elements itself. In this case, the implementation MAY use
     * {@link MTOMXMLStreamWriter#isOptimized()} to check if XOP/MTOM is enabled at all.
     * Alternatively, instead of handling {@link MTOMXMLStreamWriter} in a special way, the
     * implementation MAY use the approach described in the next item. This works because
     * {@link MTOMXMLStreamWriter} exposes the {@link DataHandlerWriter} extension. However, this
     * causes a slight overhead because the stream is first XOP decoded and then reencoded again.
     * <li>If the {@link XMLStreamWriter} exposes the {@link DataHandlerWriter} extension, but is
     * not an {@link MTOMXMLStreamWriter} (or is an {@link MTOMXMLStreamWriter}, but the
     * implementation doesn't implement the approach described in the previous item), then the
     * implementation MUST wrap the {@link XMLStreamWriter} in an {@link XOPDecodingStreamWriter}
     * and write <tt>xop:Include</tt> elements to that wrapper, so that they can be translated into
     * appropriate calls to the {@link DataHandlerWriter}. This requirement is important for two
     * reasons:
     * <ul>
     * <li>It allows Axiom to respect the contract of the
     * {@link OMSerializable#serialize(XMLStreamWriter, boolean)} method.
     * <li>If the {@link OMDataSource} is push-only (see {@link AbstractPushOMDataSource}), then it
     * enables {@link OMSourcedElement} to create {@link OMText} nodes for the binary content in an
     * efficient way.
     * </ul>
     * <li>In all other cases, the implementation MUST use
     * {@link XMLStreamWriter#writeCharacters(String)} or
     * {@link XMLStreamWriter#writeCharacters(char[], int, int)} to write the base64 encoded data to
     * the stream.
     * </ul>
     * <li>The implementation MUST NOT call {@link XMLStreamWriter#close()}.
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * On the other hand, the caller of this method (typically an {@link OMSourcedElement} instance)
     * must ensure that the following requirements are satisfied:
     * <ul>
     * <li>The namespace context information provided by {@link XMLStreamWriter#getPrefix(String)}
     * and {@link XMLStreamWriter#getNamespaceContext()} MUST accurately reflect the actual
     * namespace context at the location in the output document where the root element is
     * serialized. Note that this requirement may be relaxed if the caller implements some form of
     * namespace repairing.
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * It is assumed that this method consumes the content (i.e. destroys the backing object) unless
     * the data source also implements {@link OMDataSourceExt} and
     * {@link OMDataSourceExt#isDestructiveWrite()} returns <code>false</code>.
