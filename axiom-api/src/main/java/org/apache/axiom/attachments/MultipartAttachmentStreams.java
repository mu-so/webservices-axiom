/**
 * The MultipartAttachmentStreams class is used to create IncomingAttachmentInputStream objects when
 * the HTTP stream shows a marked separation between the SOAP and each attachment parts. Unlike the
 * DIME version, this class will use the BoundaryDelimitedStream to parse data in the SwA format.
 * Another difference between the two is that the MultipartAttachmentStreams class must also provide
 * a way to hold attachment parts parsed prior to where the SOAP part appears in the HTTP stream
 * (i.e. the root part of the multipart-related message). Our DIME counterpart didn't have to worry
 * about this since the SOAP part is guaranteed to be the first in the stream. But since SwA has no
 * such guarantee, we must fall back to caching these first parts. Afterwards, we can stream the
 * rest of the attachments that are after the SOAP part of the request message.
