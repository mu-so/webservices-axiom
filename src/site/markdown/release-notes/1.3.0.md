Apache Axiom 1.3.0 Release Note
===============================

Changes in this release
-----------------------

*   The public API now uses generics. Note that this should in general not have
    impact on binary compatibility with Axiom 1.2.x.

*   The builder implementations and related classes have been removed from the
    `org.apache.axiom.om.impl.builder` and `org.apache.axiom.soap.impl.builder`
    packages. This includes the `StAXBuilder`, `StAXOMBuilder`,
    `XOPAwareStAXOMBuilder`, `StAXSOAPModelBuilder` and `MTOMStAXSOAPModelBuilder`
    classes.

    This change was necessary to enable a refactoring and complete overhaul of
    the builders.

    As explained in the Axiom 1.2.11 release notes, application code
    should use the `OMXMLBuilderFactory` API to create builders. Code written for
    Axiom 1.2.x that uses that API remains compatible with Axiom 1.3.x.

*   Some (most? all?) of the classes in `axiom-compat` have been removed.
