Apache Axiom 1.3.0 Release Note
===============================

Changes in this release
-----------------------

*   Axiom now requires at least Java 6. Explicit dependencies on APIs that were
    not part of the JRE in Java 5 (Activation, StAX and JAXB) have been removed.

*   The public API now uses generics. Note that this should in general not have
    impact on binary compatibility with Axiom 1.2.x.

*   The builder implementations and related classes have been removed from the
    `org.apache.axiom.om.impl.builder` and `org.apache.axiom.soap.impl.builder`
    packages. This includes the `StAXBuilder`, `StAXOMBuilder`,
    `XOPAwareStAXOMBuilder`, `StAXSOAPModelBuilder` and `MTOMStAXSOAPModelBuilder`
    classes.

    This change was necessary to enable a refactoring and complete overhaul of
    the builders.

    As explained in the Axiom 1.2.11 release notes, application code
    should use the `OMXMLBuilderFactory` API to create builders. Code written for
    Axiom 1.2.x that uses that API remains compatible with Axiom 1.3.x.

*   The `BuilderAwareReader` API introduced by [AXIOM-268][] has been removed
    without replacement. There are multiple reasons for this:

    *   The only method defined by the `BuilderAwareReader` interface has a
        parameter of type `StAXBuilder`, but that class has been removed from
        the public API (see above). The parameter type would have to be changed
        to `OMXMLParserWrapper`.
    *   If the interface is considered a public API, then it is placed in the
        wrong package (`org.apache.axiom.om.impl.builder`).
    *   There are no known usages of that API.
    *   The API is merely a convenience, but doesn't provide any additional
        feature: since a builder only starts consuming the `XMLStreamReader` on
        demand, a reference to the builder can be injected into the custom
        "builder aware" reader after the builder has been created.

*   Some (most? all?) of the classes in `axiom-compat` have been removed.

*   Support for the `SOAPConstants.SOAPBODY_FIRST_CHILD_ELEMENT_QNAME` property
    introduced by [AXIOM-282][] has been retired.

*   The legacy behavior for `getChildrenWithName` implemented by [AXIOM-11][]
    is no longer supported. In Axiom 1.3.0 the QName matching is always strict.
