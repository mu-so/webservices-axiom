Apache Axiom 1.2.10 Release Note
================================

Axiom 1.2.10 is a maintenance release that contains the following improvements:
  
*   Improved DOM compatibility and performance for DOOM. Users running Rampart on Axis2 1.5.2
    may want to upgrade Axiom to 1.2.10 to take advantage of these improvements.
    
*   Improved interoperability with various StAX implementation, in particular
    support for Woodstox 4.0.
    
*   It is now possible to specify a configuration when requesting an `XMLStreamWriter`
    from `StAXUtils`, similarly to what is already possible for `XMLStreamReader` instances.
    This feature is required to support the next Abdera release (see [ABDERA-267][1]).
